What matters now is not how long we have loved each other, but how deliberately we choose to be here, in this moment, with everything that is still unfinished. I love you very much. I am scared sometimes, and unsure, and still here. I am grateful that we are counting down to the new year together, holding what we have with care, and facing whatever comes next without turning away.",
